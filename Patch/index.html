            <h3>Cookies UPDATE</h3>
            There is now a code required to access the cookie override to get access. Faliure to produce said code in 3 minutes with result in a 1 Hour ban.
            Incorrect code puts an exactly 1 Day ban.
            <h3>Patch Notes</h3>
            You've probably noticed now as you are reading it but there are patch notes with every bugfix and patch along with major updates. You should check here if something has changed.
            <h3>Efficency</h3>
            I've done some work on the website in the backend and the website should respond and load faster
            <h3>Updates on proxy situation</h3>
            The proxy is currently in the works. Rammerhead should be the provider but nothing is confirmed yet.
            Just a heads up, when the proxy is complete there will be a new hosting provider/new link due to netlify's restrictions. When this happens you will lose all your savedata.
